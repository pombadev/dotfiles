# ~/dotfiles

# Requirements

- Arch linux based distro
- Gnome DE
- I manage my dotfiles using my symlink manager [configman](https://github.com/pjmp/configman).

# Install

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pjmp/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
make home
```

# .ignore file
Put files you don't want to be symlinked in the `.ignore` file.
